### For the initial update from the launch 1.0 RC26 firmware, it is recommended to update using the reset button method rather than through the menu.

<p style="margin:20px;"></p>

## Instructions️

1. Download the appropriate zip file for the desired version.
2. Unzip the .bin and .rbf files to the root of your SD card. Overwrite 'rt4kup.bin'.
3. Optionally, delete the .rbf file corresponding to the old firmware.
4. After deleting the .rbf file, your RetroTINK-4K will not boot. If it is already powered on, you can update by going to Advanced Settings -> OSD/Firmware -> Check SD Card. Otherwise, press and hold the reset button on the back of the RetroTINK-4K down while plugging it in.
